"MOD manager for LInux, modli, handles mods for games in a simple and autonomous way that is developer friendly.

Usage:
modli OPTION [[GAME] [FILE]]
OPTIONS
=======================================================================================================================================================================
-> -i GAME: Installs a mod or script to GAME
-> -u GAME: removes a MOD from GAME 
-> -h [GAME]: Prints a brief mod formatting guide for GAME. If GAME is not passed then this help statement is printed.
-> --Launch GAME: Installs the contents of GAMEs stage file to the GAME. This is the executive function.
-> --Manage GAME: Adds GAME to mod management. 
-> --Unmanage GAME: Removes GAME from mod management.
-> --Install FILE: Installs a MOD to modli 
-> --Uninstall FILE: Removes a mod from GAME's modli directory.	

GAME
=======================================================================================================================================================================
Each GAME that is added to management contains a 'mods.stage' folder and has a directory in $root/Games, where the mods and scripts are stored.

FILE
======================================================================================================================================================================
FILE is a MOD that can be any 7z file that contains a mod for GAME. FILEs must have a file structure consistent with each GAME. For example, Fallout 4 MODs
all contain a Data folder at the root with no siblings.

Custom Scripts Directory
======================================================================================================================================================================
Users required and encouraged to make their own custom scripts for automatic installation of mods. Users are encouraged to create simple scripts that just
trim and reorganise mods, but are free to process mods however they prefer; an example script is written for Fallout 4's Script Extender."

fallout4text="Fallout 4 mods must have a single root folder named Data that contains the rest of the mod."
