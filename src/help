GAME
=======================================================================================================================================================================
Each GAME that is added to management has a directory in $root/Games, where the mods, stage file, and scripts are stored.

FILE
======================================================================================================================================================================
FILE is a MOD that can be any 7z file that contains a mod for GAME. FILEs must have a file structure consistent with each GAME. For example, Fallout 4 MODs
all contain a Data folder at the root with no siblings.

Custom Scripts Directory
======================================================================================================================================================================
Users required and encouraged to make their own custom scripts for automatic installation of mods. Users are encouraged to create simple scripts that just
trim and reorganise mods, but are free to process mods however they prefer; an example script is written for Fallout 4's Script Extender."

fallout4text="Fallout 4 mods must have a single root folder named Data that contains the rest of the mod."
