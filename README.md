# Abstract
Most (graphical) mod managers tend to abstract and hide the technical process of installing open-source content, which is convenient but not developer-friendly. That is, it is not obvious what the MM is doing to actually install the mod. Also, MMs introduce the overhead of their own systems, which makes the game system more elaborate and externally reliant. Modli's goals are to make game modification transparent and simplistic without compromising technical involvement. It is a barebones mod manager that improves usability for non-developer or naive users and to act as a springboard into software development
